# About me

I'm a physician, scientist, husband, and father. I'm interested in helping people with blood cancers and other life-limiting illnesses, using artificial intelligence* and genuine compassion.




* I much prefer the term "data science," but it was kind of cute to pair "artificial" and "genuine" that way, don't you think?
